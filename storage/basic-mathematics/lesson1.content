# Lesson 1: Introduction to Numbers

## What are Numbers?

Numbers are symbols we use to count and measure things. They help us understand how many items we have and solve everyday problems.

## Types of Numbers

### Natural Numbers
Natural numbers are counting numbers that start from 1:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

We use these to count objects like fruits, books, or students.

### Whole Numbers
Whole numbers include all natural numbers plus zero:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

Zero means "nothing" or "no quantity."

## Counting Practice

Let's practice counting objects:
- 1 apple
- 2 mangoes
- 3 bananas
- 4 oranges
- 5 guavas

## Writing Numbers

Numbers can be written in two ways:

1. **In digits**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. **In words**: one, two, three, four, five

### Practice:
- 6 = six
- 7 = seven
- 8 = eight
- 9 = nine
- 10 = ten

## Real-Life Examples

We use numbers every day:
- Counting money (5 pesos, 10 pesos)
- Telling time (3 o'clock)
- Measuring age (8 years old)
- Counting days (30 days in a month)

## Summary

Remember:
- Numbers help us count and measure
- Natural numbers start from 1
- Whole numbers include zero
- We can write numbers using digits or words

Practice counting things around you every day!
