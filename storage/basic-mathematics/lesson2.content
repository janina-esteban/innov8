# Lesson 2: Addition - Putting Numbers Together

## What is Addition?

Addition means combining or putting things together. When we add, we find out how many items we have in total.

The symbol for addition is: **+** (plus sign)
The result is called the **sum**.

## Simple Addition

Let's start with small numbers:

### Example 1:
You have 2 pencils, and your friend gives you 3 more pencils.
How many pencils do you have now?

2 + 3 = 5

You have 5 pencils in total!

### Example 2:
There are 4 birds on a tree, and 2 more birds land on it.
How many birds are on the tree now?

4 + 2 = 6

There are 6 birds on the tree!

## Addition Facts (1 to 10)

Memorize these basic addition facts:

1 + 1 = 2
2 + 2 = 4
3 + 3 = 6
4 + 4 = 8
5 + 5 = 10

1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
3 + 4 = 7
4 + 5 = 9
5 + 6 = 11

## Properties of Addition

### Order Doesn't Matter
You can add numbers in any order and get the same answer:
- 3 + 5 = 8
- 5 + 3 = 8

Both give the same sum!

### Adding Zero
When you add zero to any number, you get the same number:
- 7 + 0 = 7
- 0 + 9 = 9

## Real-Life Addition Problems

### Problem 1: At the Market
Maria bought 3 kilos of rice and 2 kilos of sugar.
How many kilos did she buy in total?

3 + 2 = 5 kilos

### Problem 2: In the Classroom
There are 6 boys and 5 girls in the classroom.
How many students are there in total?

6 + 5 = 11 students

## Practice Addition

Try these on your own:
1. 1 + 4 = ?
2. 3 + 6 = ?
3. 5 + 4 = ?
4. 2 + 7 = ?
5. 8 + 2 = ?

## Summary

- Addition means putting numbers together
- The + symbol means "plus" or "add"
- Order doesn't matter in addition
- Adding zero gives you the same number
- Practice addition every day with real objects!
