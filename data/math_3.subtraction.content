# Lesson 3: Subtraction - Taking Numbers Away

## What is Subtraction?

Subtraction means taking away or removing items from a group. When we subtract, we find out how many items are left.

The symbol for subtraction is: **-** (minus sign)
The result is called the **difference**.

## Simple Subtraction

Let's start with small numbers:

### Example 1:
You have 5 mangoes, and you eat 2 of them.
How many mangoes are left?

5 - 2 = 3

You have 3 mangoes left!

### Example 2:
There are 8 students in a group, and 3 students leave.
How many students remain?

8 - 3 = 5

There are 5 students remaining!

## Subtraction Facts (1 to 10)

Memorize these basic subtraction facts:

10 - 1 = 9
10 - 2 = 8
10 - 3 = 7
10 - 4 = 6
10 - 5 = 5

5 - 1 = 4
5 - 2 = 3
5 - 3 = 2
5 - 4 = 1
5 - 5 = 0

## Important Rules

### Subtracting Zero
When you subtract zero from any number, you get the same number:
- 7 - 0 = 7
- 9 - 0 = 9

### Subtracting a Number from Itself
When you subtract a number from itself, you get zero:
- 4 - 4 = 0
- 8 - 8 = 0

### Order Matters!
Unlike addition, order is important in subtraction:
- 7 - 3 = 4
- 3 - 7 = -4 (negative number)

Always subtract the smaller from the larger for now!

## Real-Life Subtraction Problems

### Problem 1: At the Store
Pedro has 10 pesos. He spends 4 pesos on candy.
How much money does he have left?

10 - 4 = 6 pesos

### Problem 2: In the Garden
There are 9 flowers in a garden. A goat eats 5 flowers.
How many flowers are left?

9 - 5 = 4 flowers

### Problem 3: On the Farm
A farmer has 12 chickens. He sells 7 chickens at the market.
How many chickens does he have now?

12 - 7 = 5 chickens

## Relationship Between Addition and Subtraction

Addition and subtraction are opposite operations:
- If 3 + 4 = 7, then 7 - 4 = 3
- If 5 + 2 = 7, then 7 - 2 = 5

You can check your subtraction by adding!

## Practice Subtraction

Try these on your own:
1. 6 - 2 = ?
2. 9 - 4 = ?
3. 10 - 3 = ?
4. 8 - 5 = ?
5. 7 - 7 = ?

## Summary

- Subtraction means taking away
- The - symbol means "minus" or "subtract"
- Order matters in subtraction
- Subtracting zero gives you the same number
- Subtraction is the opposite of addition
- Practice with real objects like coins or fruits!
